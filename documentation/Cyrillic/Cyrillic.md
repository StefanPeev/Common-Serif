# Cyrillic script in Unicode

## Introduction  
  
As of Unicode version 15.1, Cyrillic script is encoded across several blocks:  
  
+ **Cyrillic: [U+0400–U+04FF](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf),** 256 characters  
+ **Cyrillic Supplement: [U+0500–U+052F](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0500.pdf),** 48 characters  
+ **Cyrillic Extended-A: [U+2DE0–U+2DFF](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2DE0.pdf),** 32 characters  
+ **Cyrillic Extended-B: [U+A640–U+A69F](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA640.pdf),** 96 characters  
+ **Cyrillic Extended-C: [U+1C80–U+1C8F](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1C80.pdf),** 9 characters  
+ **Cyrillic Extended-D: [U+1E030–U+1E08F](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E030.pdf),** 63 characters  
+ **Phonetic Extensions: [U+1D2B, U+1D78](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D00.pdf),** 2 Cyrillic characters  
+ **Combining Half Marks: [U+FE2E–U+FE2F](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE20.pdf),** 2 Cyrillic characters  
The characters in the range U+0400–U+045F are basically the characters from ISO 8859-5 moved upward by 864 positions. The next characters in the Cyrillic block, range U+0460–U+0489, are historical letters, some of which are still used for Church Slavonic. The characters in the range U+048A–U+04FF and the complete Cyrillic Supplement block (U+0500-U+052F) are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script. Two characters are in the Phonetic Extensions block: U+1D2B ᴫ CYRILLIC LETTER SMALL CAPITAL EL from the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet and U+1D78 ᵸ MODIFIER LETTER CYRILLIC EN for transcribing nasal vowels.  
  
Unicode includes few precomposed accented Cyrillic letters; the others can be combined by adding U+0301 ("combining acute accent") after the accented vowel (e.g., е́ у́ э́); see below.  
  
The following two diacritical marks not specific to Cyrillic can be used with Cyrillic text:  
  
U+0301 ◌́ COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (= Cyrillic stress mark), in Combining Diacritical Marks block U+0300–U+036F. To input an accented letter with acute accent: for the letter R (for example), digit R0301 (without space between letter and number), then select 0301 only and press Alt + X = Ŕ.  
U+20DD ◌⃝ COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE (= Cyrillic ten thousands sign), in Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols block U+20D0–U+20F0  
In the table below, small letters are ordered according to their Unicode numbers; capital letters are placed immediately before the corresponding small letters. Standard Unicode names and canonical decompositions are included.
