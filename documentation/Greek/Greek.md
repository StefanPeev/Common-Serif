# Polytonic and Monotonic Greek in Common Serif

## Introduction  
  
From v.1.032 onwards, special attention is paid to both Polytonic and Monotonic Greek in Common Serif. Major sources for glyph editing decisions are: 

+ Irene Vlachou. [Polytonic Greek: a guide for type designers](https://github.com/irenevlachou/Polytonic-tutorial)  
+ Irene Vlachou. [Greek type Anatomy](https://www.type-together.com/greek-type-anatomy)  
+ Wikipedia. [Greek diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_diacritics)  
+ Wikipedia. [Smooth breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing)  
+ Wikipedia. [Rough breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_breathing)  

The following font families were used as control fonts:  

+ [Brill](https://brill.com/page/BrillFont/brill-typeface)  
+ [Gentium](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-gentium)  
+ [Source Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif)  
+ [Colvert](https://d3qx8f8l5aa3yc.cloudfront.net/images/Colvert.pdf)  
+ [GFS Artemisia](https://greekfontsociety-gfs.gr/typefaces/20th_21st_century#GFS_Artemisia)  

First, unification of the glyphs was achieved. Practice shows (compare for example with such fonts as Brill and Gentium) that glyphs ᾽(/uni1FBD, Greek Koronis) ᾿(/uni1FBF, Greek Psili) ῾(/uni1FFE, Greek Dasia) are identical in construction, applying only the corresponding rotation around the vertical axis.  
Glyphs ΄(/uni0384, Greek Tonos) `(/uni1FEF, Greek Varia) ´(/uni1FFD, Greek Oxia) are also unified in the same way.  
  
  | **alpha psili** | **alpha dasia** | **центриран** | **центриран** |  
  | **uni1F00.svg** | **uni1F01.svg** | **центриран** | **центриран** |    

## To do list  

- [ ] To prepare a full description of all available Greek glyphs according to latest Unicode standard.
- [ ] To finalize the changes in the Polytonic Greek achieving consistancy in design.
- [ ] To rethink the overall design of the Greek glyphs.
- [ ] To test horizontal metrics and to prepare proper kerning for the Greek script.
