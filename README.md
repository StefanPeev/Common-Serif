# Common Serif
The project Common Serif is based on Libertinus Serif. It starts as a fork of Libertinus Serif 7.040 version. The aim of the project Common Serif is to change the way the font family is produced. The new project is based on masters (Regular and Bold), which give a chance to interpolate 4 instances for Normal version - Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, and 4 instances for Cursive version - Italic, Medium Italic, SemiBold Italic, Bold Italic.
The project is in its beginning. Any contributions are well-come and highly appreciated.

History 
----------------

The Libertinus font project began as a fork of the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum fonts. Libertinus was forked from the 5.3.0 (2012-07-02) release of Linux Libertine fonts. The original impetus was to add an OpenType math companion to the Libertine font families. Over time it grew into to a full-fledged fork addressing many of the bugs in the Libertine fonts.

Hat-tip to Frédéric Wang for coming up with the name “Libertinus”.

Thanks to Khaled Hosny who was the primary contributor and maintainer from 2012–2020. If you like this font please thank and even consider sponsoring him!

In 2020, Khaled passed the role of maintainer on to Caleb Maclennan.

In 2022 Stefan Peev started a new project - Common Serif, which is futher development of previous project Libertinus Serif.
